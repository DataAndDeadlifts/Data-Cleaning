# Data-Cleaning
Project to practice data cleaning.

# The Data
The national drug code directory "requires registered drug establishments to provide the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a current list of all drugs manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed by it for commercial distribution."

I will be looking into this data to see how clean it is and see what I can do to make it more usable for research and secondary use.
